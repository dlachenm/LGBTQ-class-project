# LGBTQ project
Even as amateur Python coders, scripts can help ease the tediousness and concentration of time when working with data. This project is our exploration of python coding, in order to analyze what government and media information expresses about different aspects of the LGBTQ community in the United States.

We have mainly used Python coding to webscrape images and text with Beautiful Soup, as well as loops to manipulate and extract data from Data tables, turned into csv files.
